tvOS file browser thrown together in SwiftUI. Supports tvOS 13.0+

What it currently lets you do:

1. Browse file directory
2. Read text files

By default it's sandboxed, so you will need a tvOS jailbreak to use it. It's set to open / by default.

To change path, manually input the path at the top - make sure to append a / to the end or opening files doesn't work (this will be done automatically later most likely). Can read most text files if they support UTF-8

Xcode project requires Xcode 14.3+

Good luck have fun hopefully this isn't the only tvOS file browser ever
