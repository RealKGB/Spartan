tvOS file browser thrown together in swiftUI. supports 13.0+

what it currently lets you do:

1. browse file directory

By default it's sandboxed, so you will need a tvOS jailbreak to use it. It's set to open / by default.

To change path, manually input the path at the top - make sure to append a / to the end or opening files doesn't work right. currently can't read any file, just displays a blank window.

requires Xcode 14.3+ to edit

yeah have fun
